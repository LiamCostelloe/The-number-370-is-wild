I,ve noticed 37 is the main reason for 370 propertys but I think 370 has some propertys that are unique.

There a connection between 370 and 3, 9. Not 100 percent sure yet but I will figure it out.

Dividing 1111111111 by 3 creates a pattern of 370 370 370 3.
Dividing 3333333333 by 9 creates a pattern of 370 370 370 3.
