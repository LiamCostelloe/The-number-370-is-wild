I,ve noticed 37 is the main reason for 370 propertys but I think 370 has some propertys that are unique.

There a connection between 370 and 3, 9. Not 100 percent sure yet but I will figure it out.

Dividing 1111111111 by 3 creates a pattern of 370 370 370 3.
Dividing 3333333333 by 9 creates a pattern of 370 370 370 3. 

Yeah I was right I found a stange pattern with this, its not perfect and I am far to tired to
properly process the data and refine the algoritm. I'm far from finished. I'll drop the raw data I'm working on.

The data was achived with  ((x / 370) / 0.3) I'm sure I can teak it a lot more but this is far a one night will take me.
